In this work, a SEIRV model was applied to the spread of the Corona virus in Wuhan. 
I took this example to learn about how to solve sets of differential equations with python. 
The differential equations have been solved using two different python libraries: 
scipy.integrate and gekko, 
both obviously yielding the same results. 

Two files containing simple examples of both libraries are also provided.
